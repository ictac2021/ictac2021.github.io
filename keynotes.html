<h2>Concurrency and Objects Matter: Disentangling the Fabric of Real Operational Processes<h2>
<h3 style="color:#B40431;">Abstract</h3>
<p>Process mining dramatically changed the way we look at process models and operational processes.
	Even seemingly simple processes like Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) and Order-to-Cash (O2C) are often amazingly complex,
	and traditional hand-made process models fail to capture the true fabric of such processes.
	Many processes are inherently concurrent and involve interaction between different objects
	(customers, suppliers, orders, items, shipments, payments, machines, workers, etc.). 
	Process mining uses event data to construct process models that can be used to diagnose performance and compliance problems.
	If such models reflect reality well, they can be used for forward-looking forms of process mining,
	including predictive analytics, evidence-based automation, and what-if simulation.
	The ultimate goal is to create a ``digital twin'' that can be used to explore different improvement actions.
	In his keynote, Wil van der Aalst will provide an overview of process mining and the spectacular developments in the field.
	Currently, there are over 35 process mining companies (including Celonis with is the highest-valued startup in Germany)
	and most of the larger European firms have applied process mining.
	Despite the successes and mature tools, some of the foundational problems remain "unsolved" and will block future progress.
	Therefore, the keynote highlights the challenges related to concurrency and objects in process mining.</p>

<p>Prof.dr.ir. Wil van der Aalst is a full professor at RWTH Aachen University leading the Process and Data Science (PADS) group.
	He is also part-time affiliated with the Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte Informationstechnik (FIT) where
	he leads FIT's Process Mining group and the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e).
	Until December 2017, he was the scientific director of the Data Science Center Eindhoven (DSC/e) and
	led the Architecture of Information Systems group at TU/e. Since 2003, he holds a part-time position at
	Queensland University of Technology (QUT).
	Currently, he is also a distinguished fellow of Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Trento and a member of the Board of Governors
	of Tilburg University.
	His research interests include process mining, Petri nets, business process management, workflow management, process modeling,
	and process analysis. Wil van der Aalst has published over 250 journal papers, 22 books (as author or editor),
	550 refereed conference/workshop publications, and 80 book chapters.
	Many of his papers are highly cited (he one of the most cited computer scientists in the world; according to Google Scholar,
	he has an H-index of 155 and has been cited over 115,000 times), and his ideas have influenced researchers, software developers,
	and standardization committees working on process support. Next to serving on the editorial boards of over ten scientific journals,
	he is also playing an advisory role for several companies, including Fluxicon, Celonis, aiConomix, and UiPath.
	Van der Aalst received honorary degrees from the Moscow Higher School of Economics (Prof. h.c.), Tsinghua University, and
	Hasselt University (Dr. h.c.). He is also an IFIP Fellow, IEEE Fellow, ACM Fellow, and an elected member of the
	Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities, the Academy of Europe,
	and the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts (Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie der Wissenschaften
	und der Künste).
	In 2018, he was awarded an Alexander-von-Humboldt Professorship.</p>

<h2>Qualitative–Quantitative Reasoning: thinking informally about formal things<h2>
<h3 style="color:#B40431;">Abstract</h3>
<p>When I first read Hardy and Wright’s Number Theory I was captivated.  However, as much as the mathematics itself, one statement always stood out for me. 
	In the very first chapter they list a number of “questions concerning primes”, the first of which is whether there is a formula for the nth prime. 
	Hardy and Wright explicitly say that this seems “unlikely” given the distribution of the series is “quite unlike what we should expect
	on any such hypothesis.” 
	I think most number theorists would still agree with this assertion, indeed many cryptographic techniques would collapse if it such a formulae
	were discovered. 
	Yet what is this sense that the structure of primes and the structure of formulae are so different? 
	It is not formal mathematics itself, else it would be a proof.
        <br>
	In engineering, computation, physics, indeed any quantitative or formal domain, the precise and provable sits alongside an informal grasp of the
	nature of the domain.  
	This was certainly true in my own early and more recent work on formal modelling of human computer interaction: sometimes, as in the case of undo,
	one can make exact and faithful statements and proofs, but more often in order to achieve formal precision, one resorts to simplistic representations
	of real-life. 
	However, despite their gap from the true phenomena, these modes, however lacking in fidelity, still give us insight.  
        <br>
	I’m sure this will be familiar to those working in other areas where theoretical models are applied to practical problems. 
	There is a quantum-like tension between the complexity of the world and our ability to represent it, between accuracy and precision,
	between fidelity and formality. 
	Yet, we do learn about real phenomena from these simplified models, and in many contexts, from primary school estimation to scientific research
	we use these forms of thinking – I call this qualitative–quantitative reasoning.
        <br>
	This has become particularly important during Covid, when both simple formulae and massive supercomputing models offer precise predictions of the
	impact of specific interventions.
	However, even the most complex model embodies simplifications and it is when the different models lead to qualitatively similar behaviours
	that they are most trusted. 
	Similar issues arise for climate change, international economics and supermarket shopping. 
	<br>
	Qualitative–quantitative reasoning is ubiquitous, but not often discussed – almost a dirty secret for the formalist and yet what makes theory practical. 
	There are lessons for science and for schools, challenges for visualisation and argumentation. 
	I don’t know all of the answers, but by bringing this to the surface I know there are exciting questions.</p>

<p>Professor Alan Dix is Director of the Computational Foundry at Swansea University, a £31m investment by the University, Welsh Government and
	European Union to create a place to nurture fundamental digital research that makes a difference to real lives. 
	Previously he spent 10 years in a mix of academic and commercial roles.
	<br>
	Alan has worked in human–computer interaction research since the mid 1980s and is the author of one of the major international textbooks on HCI
	as well as of over 500 research publications from formal methods to design creativity.
	Last year his book “Statistics for HCI: Making Sense of Quantitative Data” has been published by Morgan & Claypool, and his new online course
	“Creativity: Methods to Design Better Products and Services” was launched at interaction-design.org. 
	His latest book, “TouchIT: Understanding Design in a Physical–Digital World” is in press with OUP and he also has a second edition of a
	textbook “An Introduction to AI” and a shorter “AI for Social Justice” under preparation.
	<br>
	Although he is known best for his research in HCI, Alan’s early academic background was in pure mathematics, where he was a member of the British team
	to the 1978 International Mathematical Olympiad in Bucharest, and also statistics completing a Diploma in Mathematical Statistics at DPMMS in Cambridge
	after finishing his BA in Mathematics a year early. 
	He has worked in mathematical modelling, and aspects of applied AI including using genetic algorithms in early submarine design and co-directing
	a dot-com era start-up on intelligent internet interfaces. 
	In 1992 he wrote possibly the first paper to highlight the potential for gender and ethnic bias in black-box machine learning algorithms and
	is now leading the algorithmic social justice theme of the UK Not-Equal network for Digital Economy and Social Justice.
	He is also a CoI on the Swansea Centre for Doctoral Training “Enhancing Human Interactions and Collaborations with Data and Intelligence Driven Systems”,
	a major initiative taking a people-first approach to AI and big data and CoI on “InterMusE – The  Internet of Musical Events: Digital Scholarship,
	Community and the Archiving of Performance” a trans-Atlantic collaboration to democratise digitisation.
